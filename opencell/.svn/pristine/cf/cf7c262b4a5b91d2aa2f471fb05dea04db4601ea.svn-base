\section{Measurement study and Key metrics prediction}
In section \ref{ltenet} we already show in proportional fair scheduler the available bandwidth for each user is a function of (i) number of users in each cell, and (ii) the channel quality for each user, so the predictability of the two determines the estimated bandwidth. In this section we conduct an extensive measurement study to show the predictability of the link channel quality and the load on eNodeBs in section \ref{CQ} and \ref{NUser} respectively. 

The traces are collected between Jun and July 2014 over several geolocations in the United States from a major cellular carrier, it covers more than half million users and over 2000 eNodeBs. The traces have been anonymized before handing to us for privacy reasons. 



\subsection{the Channel Quality}\label{CQ}
One unique characteristic for cellular network is the high mobility. The link quality can fluctuate to a certain extent due to mobility and fading effects. There are several individual studies of link mobility\cite{InfoCom14, Sprout}, however the measurements are from individual devices. On the contrary our data set covers a broad range of users and thus can give a better insight in terms of stationary vs mobile users. 

\textit{RSRQ:} Reference Signal Received Quality, is the key metric for the LTE wireless link. RSRQ senses the load from other users in the same cell and the neighboring cells, and is indexed in 0-34 integer numbers; a higher number indicates a better link quality. RSRQ values can be mapped to certain encoding rate.

\textit{Data summary:} The following plot is a 5 minutes collection at 12:00 pm Jun 11th, 2014.  Among all the users, we find most of the users have fairly stable link quality, 54.6\% of the users have a CV (coefficiency of variation) in terms of RSRQ within 0.2 and 84.1\% of the uses within 0.5. However we also have 3.6\% of the users have very dynamic link, their CVs are higher than 1. We further found 96.2\% are active in less than 10\% of the time(30s), and their CV(instability of the cellular link) is higher than the persistent users(>150s): 0.289 versus 0.153. However we also found users active in 30-60s, 60-150s are not too different from users with persistent link: 0.179, 0.164 respectively. The main reason of high CV for inactive users is the sampling issue, the sample points of two RSRQs could be very farther apart on time horizon, e.g., if the user reports RSRQ at time 1s and time 160s and idle in between, the geolocation and other factors have changed to a greater extent. 

\textit{The Occurence of Handoff}: in the dataset, handoff occurs for 30.7\% of the users, and average handoff occurence is 2.2 times. Through further investigation, we found repetitive switch between two or three neighboring cells is quite often in our dataset, mostly due to similar RSRQs (difference is less than 5 in value) from both cells, also the channel quality of one cell is fairly static, this gives us the insight that tracking users' historical RSRQ can be helpful if user .

\subsection{the Cell Load}\label{NUser}
We monitored the LTE load on several locations in both east and west coasts: west coast is in north California and Los Angeles areas; and east coast includes New England and Goergia. The trace is taken from one continuous day monitor on Jun 8th, 2014. To find the correlation  between time and load, we separate the data based on eNodeB IDs which are categorized by their geolocation information. 
\emph{Utilization of a eNodeB}: each eNodeB counts the percentage of used resource blocks in an OFDMA scheduler and uses that as an indication of eNodeB load, the eNodeB polls the cell utilization at subsecond level. Through study we notice the high dynamicity of cell loads, in terms of both short and long term. Short term variation is close to stochastic model. Over 80\% of the cells in both east and west coast have an average load under 50\% during peak hours, while more than 50\% have reached 80\% utilization at some point during the peak hour. Not surprisingly, the cells with higher utilization have lower utilization variations.  In addition, we find a very noticeable ``seasonal" effect on cell load. The eNodeBs have substantially higher load during peak hours.
