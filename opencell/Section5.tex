\section{Video optimization algorithms}\label{sec:optimization}
In this section we first define performance metrics in \autoref{subsec:metrics}. We give an offline optimization to define the video quality (efficiency) upper bound where we are aware of the available bandwidth for the whole session in \autoref{subsec:offline}.  Given the exposed APIs, we then design a new video streaming algorithm in section \ref{subsec:online},  to demonstrate the benefits of newly OpenCell.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}\label{subsec:metrics}
To help us understand what extra benefit we can achieve from new information in the cooperative model, we define \emph{three} metrics for the performance of video streaming given a known network. These metrics have been extensively studies in various approaches and here we use them as a benchmark to test our new model\cite{Qava, Avis,VideoMeasurement, Festive}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item\textit{Quality}: as the video download is chunk-based, a video session can consist of chunks with different qualities (bit rates). The video player should download the chunk with the highest possible quality based on available bandwidth at each download point to give user better quality experience. 

\item\textit{Stability}: From viewer's perspective, constant switches between different qualities are distracting and not desirable. To assess the stability of video streaming, we use the concept of fluctuation: it is the the number of jumps difference between two consecutive sessions, \emph{fluctuation cost} at time t: $\phi^t =  \|i*x_i^t - i*x_i^{t-1}\|$.

\item\textit{Interruption}: Video play should not be halted for fetching video chunks, otherwise user experience will be severely degraded. Video play interruptions affect the user engagement and results in early abandonment of the video play. Video streaming players usually buffer extra chunks to absorb any sudden drop on the link capacity. We use the frequency of interruptions over play time as an indication for interruption; $\beta = \frac{N_{interrupt}}{PlayTime}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Metrics Upper Bound}\label{subsec:offline}
Upper bounds for metrics like stability and interruption are straightforward, they should be zero in an intuitive sense. We will formulate a way to find video quality (play efficiency) upper bound, e.g., given the available bandwidth the whole video play session 1 to T, we ask for the optimal video download and play to best utilize the available bandwidth. We prioritize zero-interruption and we ignore the stability factor. 

To capture zero-interruption, at each time segment the download should always at least be equal to video played (assume at the initial state the client video buffer contains one chunk ahead of playing), i.e., $\sum \limits_{t=1}^\tau R_i * x_i^t\leq\sum\limits_{t=1}^\tau C^t$ for $\forall \tau \in \{1, \dots, T\}$. In terms of measuring the quality (play efficiency) at the end of a video session, the play efficiency equals to the total utilization of the available bandwidth over time period $[1:T]$, we use ratio of the throughput used for video downloading and playing over the available bandwidth: $\bar{E}=(\sum\limits_{t=1}^T D^t)/(\sum\limits_{t=1}^T C^t)$.

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align*}
&\textsc{maximize }&\bar{E}\\ 
&\textsc{Subject to}\\
&\sum \limits_{t=1}^\tau  \sum \limits_{i=1}^M R_i \cdot x_i^t\leq\sum\limits_{t=1}^\tau C^t& \forall \tau \in \{1, \dots, T\}\\
&\sum \limits_{i=1}^M x_i^t =1\; and\;\; x_i^t = \{0,1\}&\forall t, \forall i
\end{align*}
\end{subequations}

\end{algorithm} 

In the online algorithm, we restrict ourselves to (i) at most prefetch $z$ seconds video chunks, and (ii) only gives available bandwidth forecast for one chunk time interval. Our algorithm is a joint optimization solution based on both the video buffer occupancy and the estimated bandwidth. 

State-of-the-art video streaming algorithms \cite{BBA, Festive} share great similarities in a few aspects: (i) deferred updates of video bit rate over link condition, (ii) periodic download if video buffer is full. Our design also applies the same concepts. We now focus on the three key metrics.

% \textbf{We also show that by integrating our KPIs existing algorithm can also improve its video streaming performance, but the improvement is limited by its mismatched design where KPIs were not considered. NOT DONE YET} 

For interruption, unlike quality and stability which can be easily quantized in the algorithm, we need take an alternative view via looking at the video buffer occupancy, in particular we should avoid the video buffer empty. There is a tradeoff between prefetching, quality and interruption. Prefetching many video chunks is (i) not efficient, as it conservatively downloads more video chunks and play at lower quality; and (ii) wasteful if the viewer abandons the vide session. We factor in the video buffer occupancy to adjust requested download bit rate. If the buffer occupancy is high we can take a risk to download at higher rate beyond the estimated bandwidth and if the buffer occupancy is low we may conservatively download at lower rate than estimation. The video buffer occupancy can be used as a discount/inflation factor for the estimated bandwidth: when the buffer occupancy is low, we use the discounted bandwidth estimation and download more chunks with lower rates to fill the buffer, when the buffer occupancy is high we use the inflated bandwidth to drain the buffer a little faster. We define inflation as a concave function: $f(B)= \log(1+\frac{B}{B_{rec}})$, where $B_{rec}$ is the recommended equilibrium buffer size.  

For stability, we use exponential penalty for play bit rate jump and define the fluctuation $COST = 2^{\phi} *e^{-\alpha *\Delta t}$. The reason is to discourage but not to disallow a jump of more than one level. We also add an exponential time decaying where $\Delta t$ represents the time interval since last bit rate changes and $\alpha$ is a tunable parameter to reflect the time significance. For efficiency, we take the inverse of link utilization over inflated bandwidth to penalize the under-utilized bandwidth: $\frac{1}{E} = \frac{C}{BitRate}*\log(1+\frac{B}{B_{rec}}) $. Combine this and the fluctuation cost with a tunable knot, we have a score function $Score= \frac{1}{E} + \beta*COST$. In practice we set $\alpha=0.01$ and $\beta=1.2$ have the best performance.


We use the bit rate= $\argmin{(Score)}$ as the recommended video bit rate. We further delay the video bit rate step up or step down based on $B$ buffer occupancy and $\Delta B$ buffer change from last chunk download via the following mechanism to absorb the high link fluctuation, while $Score$ function absorbs low and median bandwidth fluctuation. We divide the buffer occupancy into two zones: risky $[0,B_{rec}]$ and safe $[B_{rec},z]$. In risky zone, if the client video buffer is depleting, if $\Delta B>0$ we defer the video bit rate stepping down, as it may just be a short period of low throughput. When $B$ is in safe zone we take more risk and step down if $\Delta B < -\frac{B_{rec}}{2}$ which means if the buffer is depleting substantially and a preemptive action is needed before stepping into risk zone. Stepping up is allowed since in risky phase the bandwidth is already a discounted bandwidth, and in safe phase we have sufficient buffer. 
  
The online algorithm continuously estimates the bandwidth for the next time segment and then computes the cost score for each video bit rate, it selects the bit rate based on $Score$ and $\Delta B$, as shown in \autoref{cap:algorithm}.
